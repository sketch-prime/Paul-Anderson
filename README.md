## About Me
My name is Paul, as you can probably tell by this file name, and I am a software engineering student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am also an IT professional, with 2 years of experience working in a college service desk position, and just under one year of experience working as desktop support for the executive office of a nuclear engineering company, BWXT. I enjoy complex problem-solving, new technology and hardware, and playing Counter-Strike 2 (I miss csgo).  


This is my coding buddy Beans:
