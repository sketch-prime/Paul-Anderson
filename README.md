# Paul-Anderson

## About Me
My name is Paul, as you can probably tell by this file name, and I am a software engineering student at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am a IT professional, having 2 years experience working in a college service desk position, and just under one year experience working as desktop support for the executive office of a nuclear engineering company, BWXT. I enjoy complex problem solving, new technology and hardware, and playing Counter-Strike 2 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6101fbf0-516b-495f-892c-5b016d61c38f)
